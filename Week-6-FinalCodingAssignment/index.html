<h1>Game of War</h1>
<h2>Dealing the Cards</h2>
<p>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, and are dealt one at a time.</p>
<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>Each player turns up a card at the same time. The player with the highest card takes both cards and puts them, face up, on the bottom of their stack of cards.</p>
<p>If the cards are the same rank...THIS MEANS WAR!!!. Each player then turns three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the highest card takes both piles. If the cards facing up are the same rank again, each player places another 3 cards
    face down and turns another card face up. This continues until one of the players has a higher card. The player with the highest card takes all cards on the board.</p>
<p>In the event War is declared and one of the players has fewer than 4 cards, this person will place his or her remaining cards face down until the individual has one left to play face up. If a player's final card ends in a draw, the player with no cards
    in their hand loses by default.</p>
